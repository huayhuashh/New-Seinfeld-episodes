# New Seinfeld episodes
Generate your own Seinfeld TV scripts using recurrent neural networks which will predict most likely words based on given word inputs. We'll be using a comprehensive dataset of Seinfeld scripts from 9 seasons of episodes. The trained RNN model will come up with new scripts entirely from being fed only one primer word!

## Starting point
The Jupyter Notebook is available in the repo. This provides you a step-by-step guide to build the RNN that will be used to generate new Seinfeld episodes.

## The machines take over
The repo also includes two examples of machine-generated scripts: one starting with the word 'Jerry' and one with 'Cramer'. It is a bit of hit and miss, and the humour is more abstract than ever. However, it is impressive how easy it is for the RNN to come up with good sentence structures after only a few iterations.

*jerry: i think it's a lot of junk.
jerry: i can't do this.
jerry: what are you doing here?
george: i can't. i was going to be held accountable.
jerry: i don't have a virgin. i don't want to hear about this.
george: what happened? you didn't even know what the cost is!*

## Next steps
This is only a starting point – feel encouraged to develop this code even further.
